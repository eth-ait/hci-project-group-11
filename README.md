# Sense Users Musical Mood, Group 11
#### Nathaniel, Florian, Alexandre, Livio, Timon

## Project description
Teufel is a German company focused on providing their clients with excitement in form of music. They offer a big variety of speakers and headsets with all of them focusing on intensity and emotions.

Everybody listens to music! The goal is to bring the music system a step further and allow a more dynamic and automated music experience to the user. Instead of constantly having to search through playlists to find a good song to play the user should be provided with music whenever and wherever he is. We are looking for more ways to make music more enjoyable.

## Ideas

### Requirements
- Active Lifestyle
- Being aware of what the user wants to listen to
- Providing the user with appropriate music at any time
- No extra hardware to carry around (use phone/speaker hardware)

### Personas

Who are the users?
We came up with three interest groups and a concrete samples of a person that fits the given lifestyles.

#### Peter, 62

Senior System Administrator: misses the good old days of radio. Listens to a lot of music but he always gets interrupted by colleagues. Stressful job, wants to put on headphones and then just have some music going. Doesn’t want to be bothered getting out the phone all the time just to adjust the music.


#### John, 28

Construction worker: Casually listens to music. But if he feels like he needs some music, he just wants to put on headphones and have some good music started. Doesn’t want to search ages for some music track he could listen to right now. Most of the time he just listens to the weekly discovery in spotify since he doesn't has any extensive playlists.



#### Courtney, 21

Instagram Influencer: Plans out all details of her life and takes pictures of everything. Takes public transportation to move between photo shoots, cafe hopping and bringing her dog on walks. Has tons of playlists and songs saved for each given task. Listens to her specific songs given what she is doing right now and how she is feeling. She has different playlists for doing yoga, go running, studying, hanging out with friends and going to bed but also for when she feels sad, lonely or when she is happy and excited.
